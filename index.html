    <h2>Bio</h2>
   
    <p>
      In 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich sent out an advertisement in Los Angeles looking for "other metal musicians to jam with," which guitarist James Hetfield had responded to. Though not yet officially formed, they had recorded a song for an album where Hetfield would be the singer and guitarist. Five months after meeting each other, <em>Metallica</em> was born! Since then, they have mostly been based in San Francisco and have become one of the most iconic metal bands in America.
